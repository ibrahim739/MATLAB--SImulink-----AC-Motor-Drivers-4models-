# MATLAB--SImulink-----AC-Motor-Drivers-4models-

MATLAB Simulink model of an AC motor with a three-phase inverter and reference source VCO (U/f = cte ) with two parts:

Controlled with feedback and uncontrolled. 

The Controlled model is subdivided into four parts:

1. Proportional correction without limitation of current
2. Proportional correction with limitation of current
3. Proportional integral correction PI without limitation of current
4. Proportional integral derivative correction PI with limitation of current

The other model is for the Uncontrolled part
